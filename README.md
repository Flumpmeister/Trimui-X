# Trimui-X  
  
Apps/Scripts that add some funcionalities to the Trimui Smart Pro.  
Currently you need to also have TRIMUI_EX or TomatoOS.  
  
### [ThemixPro](https://github.com/veckia9x/Trimui-X/tree/main/Apps/ThemixPro)  
Elevate the quality of your themes with ThemixPro.  
ThemixPro will detect when a theme is changed and update the icon, iconsel and background of each system.  
Themes must have respective folders inside for `icon`, `iconsel` and `background`.  
Each icon/iconsel/background must have the name of the system as in Emus folder. eg SFC? `icon/SFC.png`; `iconsel/SFC.png`; `background/SFC.png` (...)  
For more information on how it works please click on app name above.
  
### AlphaScraper (WIP)  
Its a scraper built for Trimui Smart Pro, but with portability in mind, meaning it should be an easy port.  
For now it just downloads media, doesnt output anything, so user has no idea what is going on. (to be changed)  
Waiting on my devID from screenscraper.fr to test some things and fix/write some code if needed.  
  
### My IP  
It uses the sdl2imgshow and displays your IP when connected to the wifi, exits in 10 seconds.  
  
### Syncthing  (current version: 1.27.3-1_aarch64)  
When launching for the first time it will download and install the necessary binaries.  
It mays seen as frozen for a couple seconds to minutes, it depends on your internet connection and the server.  
Just wait and it will exit as soon as it finishes the installation.  
  
Default user/password: `trimui`/`trimuisync`  
Theres an option to enable Syncthing on Trimui Smart Pro start.  
To enable it the user should edit file `options` inside `Apps/Syncthing/`.  
If enabled, please reboot after install completes.
