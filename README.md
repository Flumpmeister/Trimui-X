# Trimui-X  

Apps/Scripts that add some funcionalities to the Trimui Smart Pro.  
Currently you need to also have TRIMUI_EX or TomatoOS.  
  
### Syncthing  (current version: 1.27.3-1_armv7)
This is my main motivation for this repo.  
Default user/password: `trimui`/`trimuisync`  
  
When launching for the first time it will download and install the necessary binaries.  
It mays seen as frozen for a couple seconds to minutes, it depends on your internet connection and the server.  
Just wait and it will exit as soon as it finishes the installation.
  
### My IP  
It uses the sdl2imgshow and displays your IP when connected to the wifi, exits in 10 seconds.
  
### TODO:  
- make use of functions to isolate some things, add possibilities and streamline the script 
- ask for wifi to be turned on if off (MyIP app).  
- verify if some binaries are available
